#+TITLE: Chapter 1
* Exercises 1.1
1. A: Points on the real line to the left of point 7.
   B: Points on the real line excluding the segment from -2 to 2 but not
   including these two points..
   C: Points 1 and -1.
2. A: Points on the circle with radius 1 and coordinates $<x,y>$.
   B: Points below the line $x = y$ (which is the straight line defined by
   $<0,0>$ and $<1,1>$).
   C: Points on the line $$ y = 2 - x $$ (which is the straight line defined by
   $<0,2>$ and $<2,0>$).
3. a.
   b. $9 = 3 \times 3$
   c. 11 is prime
   d. This number has at least two factors, which is the two natural numbers
   multiplied together. By definition (a prime factor only has two factors, 1
   and itself), this number is not a prime.
4. a. True
   b. False. $\{3\} \in A$.
   A has 4 elements.
* Exercises 1.2
1. We illustrate using the python code below.
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    import string

    s = set(string.ascii_lowercase)
    a = set("trivial")
    a_prime = s.difference(a)
    b = set("difficult")
    b_prime = s.difference(b)

    return s.difference(a.union(b)) == a_prime.intersection(b_prime)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : True
2. $A \cap B = (\infty,-2] \cap [2,7)$
3. Trivial
4. Trivial
5.

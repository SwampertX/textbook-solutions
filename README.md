# Yee Jian's solutions
I have discovered my inner freak to document down solution to problems I
solve, since a friend asked me to send answers for certain CS2040 past year
problems. I hope I can continue this and motivate myself to do more Math/CSproblems.

*Disclaimer: since my LaTeX skills are still pretty much zero, I will be
uploading more CS than math solutions.*
